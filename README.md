Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wanted to develop a cross-platform version of their game Draw Ir or Lose It. The company had success designing for Android but wished to outsource the development of the title for cross-platform accessibility and play. This comprehensive document demonstrates the design requirements and offers reccomendations for design patterns and tools.=

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel I excelled at the reccomendation portion of the design document. This was an oppurtunity to demonstrate much of what the course covers and apply that information. I also was able to take criticism from my instructor and incorporate it into my work.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document was helpful in understanding the decsions and purpose of the code necessary to complete the course. The document made goals and intentions clear so that understanding what code and design patterns needed to be implemented was trivial. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise any one portion of the document I would revise the  executive summary. I have learned much throughout the course and my knowledge and opinion about some tools and design recommendations have changed. For example, in this portion I recommended developing native apps for each device as that would ensure the highest quality. However, as I learned more about serverless architecture and other design patterns my opinion has slightly changed on this manner. I still feel it is important to design a user-interface natively as to take advantage of certain technologies and avoid the pitfalls of others. I now understand a light-weight interface could be implemented to interact with a mostly universal server network.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Programs are products at the end of the day so while a developer may have personal desires for how they want a program to run it is indeed limited by the consumer's needs and desires. Thus these are critical to developing a successful program.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Through this course I have learned that there are little to no software problems or situations that are unique. Thus there are tried and true methodologies to solving what ever problem you are approaching. This does not mean understanding of how to develop and design these programs is irrelevant. It implies that having a deep understanding of the design patterns will give a developer the blueprints for success.
